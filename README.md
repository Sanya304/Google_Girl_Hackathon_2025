- **Backend:** Implemented with **FastAPI (Python-based)** for high-speed API responses and seamless AI integration. Handles authentication, user management, and tax automation workflows.  
- **Database & APIs:**  
  - **MongoDB Atlas**: Cloud-based NoSQL database for scalable data storage.  
  - **Google Cloud Services**: Used for AI-driven automation, tax document processing, and cloud-based authentication.  
  - **Vertex AI (Google AI Platform)**: Powers intelligent tax calculations and chatbot assistance.  
  - **Plaid/Yodlee API**: Fetches real-time financial data securely for automated tax calculations.  
  - **Google Cloud Discovery Engine API**: Enables enhanced search and recommendation features.  
- **Authentication & Security:**  
  - **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure user authentication.  
  - **OAuth 2.0** for third-party integrations.  
  - **Google Cloud IAM** for role-based access control (RBAC).   
- **Testing & Monitoring:**  
  - **Postman** for API testing.
